            <p class="section-description">Social media has become an integral part of modern life, especially for younger generations. Platforms
                such as Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat dominate online spaces and influence how people interact and
                perceive themselves. With their emphasis on instant feedback and social validation, these platforms have
                been linked to various psychological outcomes. While they can foster connection, creativity, and social
                learning, excessive or maladaptive use can lead to increased stress, anxiety, depression, and decreased
                self-esteem.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Dopamine Reward System and Social Media Addiction</h2>
            <p class="section-description">One of the central reasons social media is so engaging is its manipulation of the brain’s dopamine reward system. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, motivation, and reinforcement of
                behaviors. Every notification, like, comment, or share delivers a small dopamine release, encouraging
                repeated use. This creates a feedback loop similar to gambling or substance addiction, where users
                continually seek more stimulation.
            </p>
            <p class="section-description">
                The unpredictability of social rewards, such as the number of likes a post may receive, plays a
                significant role in reinforcing this behavior. This variable reward system keeps users engaged for
                longer periods, often at the cost of their mental well-being. Over time, individuals may become
                dependent on social media interactions to feel validated or happy, leading to emotional instability and
                distraction.

        <section id="comparison" class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Social Comparison, Self-Esteem, and Anxiety</h2>
            <p class="section-description">Social media fosters an environment of constant comparison. Users often showcase the best parts of their lives, creating a skewed reality that others perceive as normal. This leads to social comparison, where individuals evaluate their worth based on others’ curated content. Repeated exposure to idealized images and lifestyles can result in dissatisfaction with one’s own life, body image issues, and feelings of inadequacy.
</p>
        <p>In addition, the culture of likes and follows creates a form of external validation, where users rely on others’ feedback to determine their self-worth. This dependence can make them more vulnerable to negative comments, low engagement, or online criticism, which in turn fosters anxiety and depression. The fear of missing out (FOMO) further contributes to this stress, as users feel pressured to stay constantly connected to avoid being left out.
